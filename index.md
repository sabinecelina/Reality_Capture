  <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! If you're into computer vision, 3D tech, and figuring out how the reality meets the virtual world, you’re in the right place.</p>
	<p>I’m a <strong>media computer scientist  </strong> with a special love for <strong>radiance fields</strong>. By day, I work as a <strong>researcher in Reality Capture at SICK AG in Waldkirch, Germany</strong>, where I explore cutting-edge technologies and develop creative solutions to complex challenges. I’m driven by the thrill of turning ambitious ideas into impactful projects. Whether it’s uncovering innovative ways to capture the world or staying on the pulse of the latest tech breakthroughs, I’m all about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. This website is a space to share my journey, insights, and the occasional deep dive into topics I’m passionate about. I hope you enjoy exploring, and if something resonates, don’t hesitate to reach out—I’d love to connect!</p>
