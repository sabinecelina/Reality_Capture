Ever heard of Gaussian Splatting but donâ€™t know where to start? Youâ€™re not alone.

The 3D world is full of different ways to represent scenes - Photogrammetry, NeRFs, and now Gaussian Splatting - and itâ€™s easy to get lost in the technical jargon. The biggest question is: which one should you use?

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

- Photogrammetry (OBJ + texture) â†’ Uses traditional 3D meshes but struggles with soft, fuzzy, or transparent objects.
- NeRFs (neural networks) â†’ AI-powered 3D reconstructions with realistic lighting but require a trained model to render scenes.
- Gaussian Splatting (PLY + colors) â†’ Represents 3D scenes with thousands of tiny Gaussians, handling complex materials like hair, clouds, and grass better than meshes.

Whatâ€™s interesting? No matter which method you choose, they all begin with the same process: Structure from Motion (SfM). ðŸ“Œ SfM is the foundation of modern 3D reconstruction:

- Photogrammetry â†’ Converts sparse point clouds into dense meshes (RealityCapture, Agisoft Metashape).
- NeRFs â†’ Uses the camera parameters to train a neural network (Instant-NGP).
- Gaussian Splatting â†’ Uses the sparse cloud as the base for optimizing Gaussian splats (Postshot, Luma AI, Scaniverse).

Tools like Colmap and RealityCapture are often used to handle this SfM preprocessing, feeding the results into NeRF pipelines, Gaussian Splatting optimizers, or photogrammetry software. So in short: No matter which method you pick, it all starts with SfM-based camera pose estimation and point cloud generation.

Good news: You donâ€™t need to be a researcher or an engineer to get started. This guide breaks it down step by step, giving you the best tools to jump in without drowning in technical jargon or endless installations. Letâ€™s get you creating awesome 3D modelsâ€”fast and frustration-free.

## Whatâ€™s the Big Deal with Gaussian Splatting?

If youâ€™re here, you probably have a rough idea, but letâ€™s make sure weâ€™re on the same page. Instead of using points or meshes, Gaussian Splatting represents a scene as thousands of 3D Gaussians. Each one has:

- A position, orientation, and scale
- Color and transparency
- A smooth way of blending into the final render

Unlike NeRFs, which encode all scene information inside a neural network (so you need a model to "decode" it every time you render), Gaussians are explicitâ€”meaning:
- No waiting for a neural net to process every frame
- Faster rendering with direct edits (tweak splats like pixels!)
- More control over the final output

Simply put: Gaussians give you freedom, while NeRFs are like magic boxes that you have to politely ask for results.

### **Which Tool Should You Use? - A brief overview**  

- **For the fastest, easiest experience** â†’ **Scaniverse** (local processing, quick results)  
- **For advanced cloud-based reconstruction** â†’ **Luma AI** (high-quality outputs)  
- **For professional mesh conversion** â†’ **KIRI Engine** (detailed outputs, but requires a subscription)  
- **For full local control and real-time training** â†’ **Postshot** (best for users with an Nvidia GPU)  
- **For browser-based Gaussian Splatting** â†’ **Polycam** (web app, easy entry point)  

If you want a **quick and free** way to experiment, **Scaniverse or Polycam Web** are great starting points. For those needing **higher-quality outputs** with additional control, **Luma AI or KIRI Engine** are strong choices. If **local processing is a must**, then **Postshot** is the best solutionâ€”especially for users with an RTX GPU.  

# Letâ€™s Dive In â€“ A Closer Look at Each Tool

Now that you have a birdâ€™s-eye view, letâ€™s break it down: how each tool works, what itâ€™s best for, and how you can start using it today.

## Scaniverse â€“ The Easiest Way to Splat (iOS & Android)

Want a fast, no-fuss way to generate a Gaussian Splat on your phone? Scaniverse is your new best friend.

**Why Scaniverse?**
- Super simple: Open the app, scan, done.
- Runs locally: No cloud processing, no privacy concerns.
- Works on both Android & iOS.

Bonus: You can export the gaussian splatting scans as PLY files, making it easy to refine in Blender, Unity, or Unreal Engine.

If you're looking for a quick and accessible way to experiment with Gaussian Splatting, Scaniverse is a great place to start.

# LUMA AI - More Power, but with Cloud Processing
Luma AI makes Gaussian Splatting accessible with a simple capture process. Unlike Scaniverse, it processes data in the cloud, taking about 20 to 30 minutes before delivering the final model. Originally focused on NeRFs, Luma AI switched to Gaussian Splatting for faster rendering and better compatibility. If you donâ€™t mind waiting a bit, Luma AI gives you high-quality Gaussian Splats by processing everything in the cloud.

### Key Features:
- Cloud-based processing (takes 20-30 min per scan)
- Supports iOS & Android
- Multiple export formats: OBJ, USDZ, GB, PLY

## KIRI Engine â€“ When You Need Pro-Level Mesh Conversion

The KIRI Engine app offers 3DGS along with a **Mesh 2.0 pipeline**, improving the conversion of Gaussian splats into detailed meshes. This update enhances handling of reflective and transparent materials using advanced normal prediction and reflection removal techniques.  

### Key Features
- Automatic background removal: Helps isolate objects, though it can misidentify certain elements as part of the scene.  
- High mesh quality
- Cloud-based processing
- Adjustable lighting and contrast: Allows fine-tuning of scans for better results.  
- Export options: Supports **OBJ, PLY, GLTF** for meshes and `.ply` for Gaussian Splats.  

KIRI Engine is a powerful tool for users who need high-quality meshes from Gaussian Splats, but its reliance on cloud computing and paid access model (â‚¬90/year to unlock 3DGS) make it less accessible compared to free alternatives like Scaniverse.
