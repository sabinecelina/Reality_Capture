> I never meant to design a grand master‑plan; I simply followed one small curiosity after another and, before I knew it, a thesis had turned into a career.

<!-- 
It was a grey Monday afternoon when I slid into the lecture called “The Future of Digital Media.”  
The rain on the window-panes kept time with our professor’s voice as he rattled off promising research topics. Then, as the class packed up, he caught my eye and told me about an open master’s thesis at **SICK AG** on **Neural Rendering**. I had first bumped into **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)** months earlier in a Computer Vision lecture, but hearing the term now - paired with a real industrial project - made it crackle with possibility. By the end of the lecture I had already opened a dozen tabs on my laptop, chasing links and demo videos. That spontaneous deep-dive felt like finding the edge of a treasure map.

### A quick detour that changed everything

Before I could even draft a thesis proposal, the lecture **required** us to turn our curiosity into a mini-research project for the course. Two weeks later I was:
* reading code at 2 a.m.,  
* hacking together a tiny demo scene, and  
* writing a five-page paper that tried (and mostly failed) to explain NeRFs without equations overflowing the margins.

Presenting it forced me to translate mathmagic into mathematics. Each question from classmates burned a new connection into my brain. By the final slide I knew **this** was the direction I wanted.

### The thesis: NeRFs meet the Industrial Metaverse

SICK’s topic sounded almost sci-fi: *“Neural Radiance Fields in the context of the Industrial Metaverse.”*  On day one I walked into their lab, surrounded by lidar scanners, depth cameras, and more cables than a small data centre. My mission:

> Capture reality so faithfully that a digital twin could fool your intuition.

Months blurred into experiments—Gaussian splatting on factory floors, dataset wrangling, nights staring at loss curves that refused to budge. Once I even turned a conveyor belt into an accidental cubist painting. But the first time a dense, photoreal point cloud popped up on screen, the whole team stopped to stare.

Over the next weeks, my curiosity spiraled into action. For the course I wrote a short paper on NeRFs, treating it like a tiny laboratory: testing, breaking, tinkering. 

When SICK formally offered the thesis topic “Neural Radiance Fields in the Context of the Industrial Metaverse,” I accepted before my heartbeat slowed. Suddenly my student apartment was overflowing with LIDAR scans, calibration boards, and little paper notes taped to the wall: speed vs. accuracy, indoor fog, edge‑case reflections. Days blended into nights lit by dual monitors and too much coffee.

But it never felt lonely. Each week I sent progress snippets to my university advisor and the engineers at SICK—half status report, half excited diary entry. More than once a late‑night Slack message from a colleague solved a bug I’d been chewing on for hours. Together we nudged NeRF pipelines until they behaved, coaxing photorealistic point clouds out of chaotic sensor data.

The thesis defense arrived like a freight train. I remember setting up the projector, palms sweaty, and thinking, “This is just another class talk—except the audience decides my future.” Forty minutes later I finished my last slide, and the room was still. Then came a single nod from the committee chair, and the tension cracked into smiles.

What I didn’t expect was what happened next. SICK asked if I would stay on as a Research Engineer for Reality Capture. One week I was polishing citations; the next I had a badge, a desk, and a backlog of ideas labeled urgent. My job description was simple: capture reality better than yesterday. That meant NeRFs, yes, but also Gaussian Splatting, instant‑NGP tricks, anything that helped translate raw photons into the building blocks of a digital factory.

The thesis morphed again—first into a full conference paper, then into a chapter of our university’s annual research report. The cherry on top was the Erwin‑SICK Prize for Outstanding Master’s Thesis. I still keep the certificate in the same folder as the very first NeRF screenshot I ever rendered; they feel like two ends of the same thread.

Looking back, the path feels impossibly coherent, like dots that always intended to connect. But in truth, each step was just the most interesting option available that day: turning right instead of left, clicking Open New Tab, saying yes to an email.

So if you’re standing at the edge of your own curiosity cliff, here’s my unasked‑for advice:

Follow the sparks. They might look small, but they light bigger fires.

Show unfinished work. Your half‑baked demo could be someone else’s missing puzzle piece.

Accept detours. The scenic routes often hide the best mentors—and the best stories.

I never planned for a prize, a paper, or a title with Reality Capture in it. I just chased an idea because it refused to leave me alone. If something refuses to leave you alone, maybe give it a chance. You might wake up one rainy Tuesday and realize you’ve written your own unexpected story.

Thanks for reading. If your passion intersects with NeRFs—or if you haven’t figured out your passion yet—feel free to reach out. I’m still learning, and good journeys are better when shared.
