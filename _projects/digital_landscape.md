**Digital Landscape** is an interdisciplinary student project that merges **conceptual design**, **3D scanning**, and **physical prototyping** to reconstruct a forest through all four seasons – both visually and structurally.

Our goal was to create a digital nature experience that transforms over time, mimicking the evolution of a real ecosystem. The final result was exhibited at the *Instand Festival* as a multi-projection installation enriched by physical models and point cloud visualizations.

### Reconstructing a Forest: From Idea to Point Cloud

We began by developing a strong conceptual foundation. Inspired by immersive games and the aesthetics of natural change, we designed a seasonal forest that transitions from spring to winter. Using moodboards, research imagery, and field impressions, we created a rich visual narrative of nature’s temporal transformation.

To bring this idea to life, we performed a **full-scale photogrammetric capture** of a real forest segment. This included:

- Planning and scouting suitable locations
- Capturing ~7,500 high-resolution images
- Segmenting the site into multiple scanning zones
- Building accurate point clouds with Agisoft Metashape

Because of environmental complexity (sunlight variations, foliage motion, uneven terrain), this was not a typical photogrammetry task. We experimented with drones and lenses, ultimately selecting the **Güntherfelsen** area for its geometric clarity and accessibility.

Despite software and hardware limitations (e.g., Metashape licensing, render crashes, 26-day estimation for dense cloud rendering), we managed to extract and merge high-quality point clouds using **Blender** and specialized plugins.

### Physical Modeling: 3D Printing & Real-World Presence

To complement the digital experience, we also created a **3D-printed globe** that symbolized the cyclical nature of time and seasons. I used the **Ultimaker S5** printer and solved multiple hardware issues (oversized spools, extrusion failures) to finalize the model in time for the exhibition.

### Festival Installation & Presentation

The final installation included:

- A three-beamer projection setup with adaptive geometry
- A printed physical model as centerpiece
- Curated lighting and staging
- Real-time visuals from our point cloud dataset
