This project focused on the **digital preservation of medieval gargoyle sculptures** from the *Freiburg Minster*, combining **photogrammetry**, **3D reconstruction**, and **interactive storytelling**.

As part of a multidisciplinary team, I was responsible for the **complete digital capture and cleanup of the gargoyle statues** using *Agisoft Metashape* and *Blender*. The goal was to bring these cultural artifacts into an **accessible and engaging form** for younger audiences and museum visitors.

### From Real Stone to Real-Time 3D

We scanned original gargoyle statues located in the restoration workshop of the Freiburg Minster. Due to spatial constraints, some models were challenging to capture, but we optimized our approach using high-resolution photogrammetry and careful retopology in Blender.

**Key 3D techniques used:**

- High-resolution mesh generation in Metashape  
- Retopology with Blender's Quad Remesher  
- Hole-filling and sculpt-based mesh repair  
- Normal map baking for detail preservation at low poly count

This workflow allowed us to preserve historic detail while maintaining performance for interactive use.

### Cultural Heritage as Interactive Experience

To make the reconstructions more engaging, we embedded them in a **Unity-based tower defense game**. Players strategically place the scanned gargoyle models to defend the Minster against demons – inspired by medieval lore where gargoyles were believed to repel evil.

The game was presented publicly at the **Coding da Vinci hackathon** and featured in a museum setting, showcasing how **digital tools can revitalize cultural storytelling**.
